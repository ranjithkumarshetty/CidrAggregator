# CidrAggregator

This utility demonstrates how to aggregate CIDRs to the least specific subnets possible that contain exactly all given objects in Java using [commons-ip-math](https://github.com/jgonian/commons-ip-math) library. This is equivalent of how perl's [NetAddr::IP](http://search.cpan.org/~luismunoz/NetAddr-IP-4.007/IP.pm) does compaction.
